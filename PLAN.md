## Why we're building our own solution?
Pipedream has been a great tool for building and deploying our workflows, but we have encountered some limitations that have prompted us to build our own solution. The main reasons for this transition include:
1. **Cost**: Pipedream's pricing model has become a concern as our usage has increased, leading to higher costs that are not sustainable for our project.
2. **Performance**: We have experienced performance issues with Pipedream, particularly with the speed of execution and reliability of workflows.
3. **Flexibility**: We need more flexibility in terms of custom integrations and the ability to run workflows in a more controlled environment.
4. **Scalability**: As our project grows, we need a solution that can scale with us without significant performance degradation or cost increases.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Pipedream's testing and debugging capabilities are not sufficient for our needs, making it difficult to ensure the reliability of our workflows.
6. **Technical Limitations**: We have encountered technical limitations with Pipedream that hinder our ability to implement certain features or integrations. e.g. 
   - I remember needing to run Puppeteer in a workflow to scrape some data, but it was not possible to do so in Pipedream.
   - Some workflows require more complex logic or state management which is not possible with Pipedream's current capabilities.

So our primary objective is to build a solution that addresses these limitations while providing a robust and scalable platform for our workflows. We'll also bring in the workflows that scattered across different platforms like Zoho Inventory, Zoho CRM, Zoho Desk etc. into a single platform to manage all our workflows in one place if possible.

## Backend Roadmap
- [x] **Architecture Design**: Define the architecture of the backend system, focusing on modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
- [x] **Codebase Setup**: Set up the initial codebase with a focus on modularity and scalability.
- [x] **Authentication**: Implement a secure authentication system to manage user access with JWT tokens and role-based access control.
- [x] **Real-time Communication**: Set up a real-time communication system using Socket.IO to enable real-time updates and notifications for the UI.
- [x] **Task Management**: Implement a task management system that can queue, execute, and monitor tasks. This should include support for retries, error handling, and logging.
- [x] **API Integration**: Create a flexible API integration system that allows us to define and manage API connections. This should support authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.
- [ ] **REST API**: Expose the core functionality of the backend such as Replaying events, connecting to external APIs, etc.

## Frontend Roadmap
- [x] **Codebase Setup**: Set up the initial codebase.
- [ ] **UI Library**: Choose a React UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, Radix UI).
- [ ] **Authentication**: Integrate the authentication system with the frontend to manage user session.
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to display the status of workflows, and API connections.
- [ ] **User Management**: Implement user management features to allow admins to manage users.
